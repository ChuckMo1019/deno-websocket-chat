# Real-time Chat App with Deno and Websockets

This is a demo of a real-time chat app using Deno. It extends the original project (https://github.com/thecodeholic/deno-websocket-chat) to include a WYSIWYG HTML editor.

--------------------

## Installation
You need to have [Deno installed](https://deno.land/#installation) in order to run this app locally

1. Clone this repository (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/benlongdev/deno-websocket-chat.git`)
2. From within the project's root directory, run `deno run --allow-net server.ts`
3. Open `public/index.html` in your browser
4. Join a chat room and start typing
5. To demo two participants, open `public/index.html` in another window and join the same chat room
